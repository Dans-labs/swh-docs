!!! note "Living Document (WIP), 27 February 2024"

    This work is carried out in the context of the [FC4E project]{target="_blank"} (Data Infrastructure Capacities for EOSC), funded by the EU's Horizon 2020 project call HORIZON-INFRA-2021-EOSC-01. <br />
    It is developed by Task 6.1: "API and Connectors Between Scholarly Repositories and Software Heritage", as part of the working package 6 (WP6): "Services and tools to archive, reference, describe and cite research software".

Currently, this documentation targets two groups, i.e:

* [Researchers](researchers.md) that want to archive software code related data, like source code, related datasets and their metadata. This documentation is the closest thing to a user manual.

* [Developers](developers.md) that need insight in the applications that make up the entire service. This most closely resembles technical documentation.
