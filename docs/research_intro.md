DANS SWH Deposit Form for Researchers
========================================

!!! caution

    Please be aware that this is a demo environment for both the underlying Dataverse instance and the SWH archive.  
    This means that there is no guarantee of long-term archiving and that uploaded resources may be deleted at any time. 

This document contains instructions and prerequisites for depositing your software code and associated datasets to a dataset repository (Dataverse instance) and to the [Software Heritage]{target="_blank"} (SWH) archive.   
This is accomplished by supplying all the information into one input form only.  This deposit form takes care of depositing the supplied artifacts and their relevant metadata to both endpoints and will create references to each other by updating the endpoints with the persistent identifier minted and obtained from the deposit endpoints.  

At the time of writing, the deposit form is connected to the (DANS) [Dataverse demo]{target="_blank"} instance.  
This is where your uploaded files and their relevant metadata will be archived to.  
The Dataverse target instance may be changed at anytime in the future.

Please read the [prerequisites](research_prerequisites.md) carefully before continuing to the [deposit manual](research_manual.md) page.
