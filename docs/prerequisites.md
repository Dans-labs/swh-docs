Prerequisites
=============

Before you can start using the deposit form, you must have at least the following in place.  
Otherwise the deposit form will not submit your data!

**It is important to go through these steps before your deposit!**   
There are several actions to complete now, but most of them you only have to perform once before you start depositing for the first time.   
Next time you only have to log in to the deposit input form to be able to deposit again.

### Dataverse account
The deposit form will deposit the sourcecode related (meta)data to the connected Dataverse instance on your behalf.  
To be able to so, you need to supply your [Dataverse API-token](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/api/auth.html){target="_blank"} to the deposit form. Therefore you must have a Dataverse account on the connected (DANS) [Dataverse demo]{target="_blank"} instance.
**To register and get your account do the following:**

1. Goto the [Dataverse demo]{target="_blank"} instance.
2. Register
3. You can retrieve your Dataverse API-token from within the deposit form later in another step.

Of course this is a one-time operation!

### Depost-form account
> What account is enabled on the depost form?

Again, this is a one-time operation!
 
### Source code repository
In the current version, only public [GitHub](https://github.com/){target="_blank"} repositories are allowed for archival at SWH. Make sure you know which repository (url) you want Software Heritage to archive for you.     
Other repository types or forges are planned in future releases and will be listed here, when available.

### File formats
The (data)files you are about to deposit, must have one of the formats listed on the DANS webpage about [file formats](https://dans.knaw.nl/en/file-formats/){target="_blank"}.  
The file format may appear in either the list of "Preferred formats" or the list of "Non-preferred formats." As long as the file format is mentioned in one of the two lists.


Once you have completed all of the above steps, you are good to go for the [next step](user_manual.md).
